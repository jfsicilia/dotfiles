# JFSicilia's dotfiles

To get my dotfiles, clone them by typing:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/jfsicilia/dotfiles
~~~

If you want to put them in a specific path, simply type:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/jfsicilia/dotfiles this/is/my/path
~~~

**Note:** I put my dotfiles in my ```~/Documents/settings/dotfiles``` and then create a symlink from ```~/.dotfiles```. I have used the symbolic links approach for my dotfiles, so every config file in my home directory will be a symlink to my ```~/.dotfiles``` version.

*Config files in my home dir link to .dotfiles version:*

~~~bash
.bash_profile -> ~/.dotfiles/bash/bash_profile.symlink
.bashrc -> ~/.dotfiles/bash/bashrc.symlink
.gitconfig -> ~/.dotfiles/git/gitconfig.symlink
.gitignore_global -> ~/.dotfiles/git/gitignore_global.symlink
.tmux.conf -> ~/.dotfiles/tmux/tmux.conf.symlink
.vimrc -> ~/.dotfiles/vim/vimrc.symlink
.zshrc -> ~/.dotfiles/zsh/zshrc.symlink
~~~ 

## Installation

When you have cloned the repository, go to the dotfile folder and execute:

~~~bash
install.sh
~~~

It would prompt asking for your password, and then it would start executing the scripts (.sh) in the ```install``` folder.
